# WebAudit
WebAudit was a project created by myself as partial fulfilment of the requirements for an honours degree at Plymouth University. 

The idea of Web Audit project was to identify security pitfalls of websites and to recommend solutions to the problems it found. It aimed to be as user friendly as possible and would be made so that those with little technical background could understand the solutions it proposed.

The application was split into two components. The first component being a Python application that would do most of the scanning work. The second component is a PHP website that allows users to add websites, start scans and view scan reports.

# Python component

This repository contains the Python application that was produced. This was my first ever Python application so the code may not be the best and may not follow all best practices or have a standard project layout. It was built on Python 3.4.2 and utilised a MySQL database.

# Website component

The repository for the web component can be found here: https://github.com/benscobie/webaudit-website
